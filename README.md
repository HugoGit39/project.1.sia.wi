## About

<p align="justify">
  Stress in Action capitalizes on the fast advances in technology and big data analytics to move stress research from the lab to daily life. The Consortium enables synergistic collaborations to discover 1) how responses to daily life stress arise from the temporal, dynamic interplay between context and person-specific factors, 2) how daily life stress can be reliably measured in a specific individual in real-time, and 3) how and when potential beneficial stress-response mechanisms turn into detrimental effects on mental and cardiometabolic health. This enables the development of novel monitoring and intervention strategies to track and reduce daily life stress and its health impact.

  For point 2:  how daily life stress can be reliably measured in a specific individual in real-time using daily life stress assessment tools, selection and validation pipelines in our design field labs will establish their ethical and legal feasibility, user-acceptance, reliability and validity, and potential application in just-in-time adaptive stress interventions.

  This GitHub repository contains an R Shiny app developed using the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem">golem</a> framework. The app showcases the results of the wearable validation pipeline, offering a robust platform for visualizing and analyzing data. Designed for efficiency and scalability, the application provides insights into the validation process, allowing users to interact with and explore the outcomes of the wearable technology assessment.
